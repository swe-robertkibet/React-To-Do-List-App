# Todo App

This is a simple and responsive Todo application built with React. It allows users to add, toggle, and delete todo items. The application also persists data using `localStorage` to ensure todos are saved even after the browser is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Todo Items**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
- **Toggle Completion Status**: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, visually indicated by a line-through effect.
- **Delete Todo Items**: Users can remove tasks from the todo list.
- **Persistent Storage**: The todo items are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist even when the browser is refreshed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Techniques Used

### React Hooks

- **useState**: Manages the state of the todo items and the input reference.
- **useRef**: Accesses the input element to read its value when adding a new todo item.
- **useEffect**: Handles side effects, such as fetching and saving data to `localStorage`.

### State Management

- **State Updates**: The state of the todo list is managed using React's `useState` hook, ensuring a reactive UI that updates when the state changes.

### Local Storage

- **Data Persistence**: `localStorage` is used to save and load the todo items and the item count, providing persistence across browser sessions.

### Responsive Design

- **Flexbox**: Utilized for layout management to ensure the app looks good on different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Applied in CSS to adjust styles for various screen widths, making the app mobile-friendly.

### CSS Styling

- **Component-Specific Styles**: Separate CSS files for each component (`Todo.css` and `TodoItems.css`) ensure modular and maintainable styles.
- **Dynamic Classes**: Conditional classes (e.g., `line-through`) are used to dynamically style elements based on their state.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with separate components for the main Todo functionality and individual Todo items. Each component has its own CSS file for styling, ensuring a clean and modular codebase.
